A python module for usernames and passwords.

**Soter**
 Greek daimon of safety

Soter generates and stores a `hashed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function>`_ and `salted <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)>`_ password alongside the associated username.
The module can then check an entered password against the original.
